# AI-Recycling-Bin
This repository contains the code for my Engineering Design and Development project, an AI powered recycling bin.  This project uses a custom trained model to determine what material an item which is then used to make a decision on whether it should be recycled or not. All of this code is going to be run through a raspberry pi.
